<!-- # Position:absolute
Reference: https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-position

With position: absolute, an element ignores the normal document flow. 
However, instead of being positioned relative to the viewport (like with position: fixed), 
it’s positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(a positioned ancestor is any element with a position value besides static, the default).

Here, div 2 is placed inside a container div (in gray) and positioned relative to the container, 
since the container is the nearest ancestor element of div 2.
If there’s no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the containing block and 
moves with scrolling.
